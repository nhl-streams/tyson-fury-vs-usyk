			<p>Two of the best heavyweights of a generation are set to collide for a second time on Saturday night. Oleksandr Usyk and Tyson Fury meet once again in Saudi Arabia with three of the four recognized titles in the heavyweight division at stake along with plenty of bragging rights. 

Usyk became the first undisputed heavyweight champion of boxing's four-belt era when he took a split decision over Fury in May. With the win, Usyk added Fury's WBC championship to his own IBF, WBA and WBO titles. The feat of going undisputed was a repeat of what Usyk had already achieved earlier in his career at cruiserweight before moving to boxing's glamor division to chase further glory.

The loss was the first of Fury's career and came after he started well in the fight only for Fury to turn the tables and start to land heavy shots that repeatedly had Fury on his heels.

"I've got nothing to say apart from there's going to be a whole lot of hurt and pain in this fight, you watch," Fury said at the final press conference. "The talking's been done. The first fight, I talked, I joked, all my career. This time I'm serious, I'm going to do some damage here on Saturday night. Watch me go to work."

A rematch clause was included in the contract and Fury activated it to get a shot at regaining championship status. This led to the IBF stripping Usyk of their belt for failing to fight a mandatory opponent rather than the only other man on the planet with a claim to being the best heavyweight in the game.</p>
	
<p>While that means the rematch won't be for undisputed status -- Daniel Dubois has since been named IBF champion -- it is the biggest heavyweight fight possible and a chance for both men to add to their already impressive legacies.

The undercard was set to feature a solid matchup between Serhii Bohachuk and Israil Madrimov at junior middleweight. Unfortunately, Madrimov was forced to withdraw from the bout after suffering from bronchitis during training camp. His next appearance is expected to be on the Feb. 22 card featuring Artur Beterbiev vs. Dmitry Bivol 2 in the main event where he will face another top contender in Vergil Ortiz. Instead, Bohachuk will take on Ismael Davis. 

Let's take a look at the full card for Usyk vs. Fury 2 as well as all the information you need to follow the action throughout the week.</p>
